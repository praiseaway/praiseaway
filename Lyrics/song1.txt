He is Worthy

Verse 1
Holy, holy is the Son of God
None can stand before His majesty
Beautiful beyond our highest thought
Worthy! He is worthy!

Verse 2
Holy, holy is the Word made flesh
King who bore our pain and poverty
Come to claim the rebel and the wretch
Worthy! He is worthy!

Chorus
All glory and honor, all power and praise
Be to Your Name, be to Your Name
For no one could rival Your glory and fame
We lift high the Name of Jesus

Verse 3
Holy, holy is the Lamb who died
Canceling our debt at Calvary
Rising from the grave to reign on high
Worthy! He is worthy!

Bridge
Holy, holy, Lord Almighty
Worthy is Your Name
Holy, holy, none beside You
Greatly to be praised
