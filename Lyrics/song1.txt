Oh But God 

Verse 1

I was buried beneath my rebellion
Lost without hope of redemption
Blind in my need for a Savior
Oh but God

Verse 2

Crushed by the weight of my failure
Living the lie I created
Digging my grave without knowing
Oh But God oh But God

Chorus

Rich in mercy how You loved me
Too much to let me stay lost
My salvation sent from heaven
Nailing my sin to a cross

Verse 3

You gave me a truth worth believing
And I traded my chains for Your freedom
Cause You were the One that I needed
Oh But God

Verse 4

Resurrected my heart from the ruins
And my rescue came through like the morning
And now this is my sure testimony
Oh But God oh But God

Chorus

Rich in mercy how You loved me
Too much to let me stay lost
My salvation sent from heaven
Nailing my sin to a cross

Bridge 1

All the wreckage
Of my choices
You have turned to
Life from ashes

Bridge 2

Lifted from death
Risen with Him
Now I stand in confidence

Bridge 1

All the wreckage
Of my choices
You have turned to
Life from ashes

Bridge 2

Lifted from death
Risen with Him
Now I stand in confidence

Chorus

Rich in mercy how You loved me
Too much to let me stay lost
My salvation sent from heaven
Nailing my sin to a cross

Chorus

Rich in mercy how You loved me
Too much to let me stay lost
My salvation sent from heaven
Nailing my sin to a cross oh but

Outro

God oh but
