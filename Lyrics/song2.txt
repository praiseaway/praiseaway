Good Good Father

[Verse 1]
Oh, I've heard a thousand stories of what they think You're like
But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night
And You tell me that You're pleased
And that I'm never alone

[Chorus]
You're a Good, Good Father
It's who You are
It's who You are
It's who You are
And I'm loved by You
It's who I am
It's who I am
It's who I am

[Verse 2]
Oh, I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
But I know we're all searching
For answers only You provide
Cause You know just what we need
Before we say a word

[Chorus]
It's who You are
It's who You are
It's who You are
And I'm loved by You
It's who I am
It's who I am
It's who I am

[Bridge]
Cause You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways to us, aah
You are perfect in all of Your ways
Oh, you're perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways to us


[Chorus]
You're a Good, Good Father
It's who You are
It's who You are
It's who You are
And I'm loved by You
It's who I am
It's who I am
It's who I am
